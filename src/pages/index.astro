			<h1 class="uppercase">WILLIAM "ZY" YAO</h1>
			<p>
				William is a multidisciplinary Director and Creative
				Technologist who seeks for stories rooted in honest
				conversation, evanescent moments of nature, and the search for
				joy and love. His work includes Films, Off-Broadway, and large
				scale Live Productions. William loves Wong Kar Wai but secretly
				binges Taika Waititi when his colleagues aren’t around.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				When he’s not crumpling up scripts or fighting AI overlords,
				William is a dancer and a musician, with credits including
				MARVEL, SAMSUNG, and CANNES FILM FESTIVAL XR.
