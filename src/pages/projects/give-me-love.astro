				GIVE ME LOVE (2024)
			</h1>

			<p class="mt-10">
				'Give Me Love' began as a compassionate exploration of the
				suppression of male emotions and their impact on others. As the
				film developed, I found myself confronting my ideals of
				manhoodâ€”ideals that stood in sharp contrast to those my father
				instilled in me: the 'proper' man, endowed with noble
				responsibilities, a stern and respectable composure, and an
				immunity to shedding tears. I believed that by being in tune
				with my emotions, I would achieve my vision of manhood. Yet, the
				man I aimed to be remained distant from the facade I actually
				wore.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				This realization sparked deeper contemplation on my father's
				personal struggles. Could the capricious flashes beneath his
				rigid exterior signify his own struggle? Was he, too, laboring
				to reconcile his outward persona with an internal ideal that
				remained elusive?
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				This film does not attempt to provide answers about emotional
				repression, rather, it aims to observe the internal struggle
				experienced when one's emotions are not permitted to surface,
				and the profound loneliness that ensues.
